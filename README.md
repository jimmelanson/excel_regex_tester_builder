# excel_regex_tester_builder
An Excel-based utility to help you learn to build and/or test your regular expressions.

This utility is composed of three principal parts:

**RegexTester**<br>
This worksheet will allow you to enter your own regular expression and test against 1 to 100 lines of data.

**Examples**<br>
This worksheet contains multiple examples of regular expressions. Right-click on any example and it will be transferred to the RegexTester worksheet along with several lines of data for you to see the regular expression evaluating.

The sheet contains ample room for you to save your own regular expressions.

**Builder**<br>
This worksheet give you the opportunity to build expressions one item at a time. It provides the correct syntax so that you can update it with the correct values. A big benefit of this page is helping you get the idea and value of grouping your expressions.

This page also has six predefined examples that let you see exactly how to build a new expression from the ground up.

This page also offers brief notes on each syntax you choose, or the predefined expression you select.

This was developed on the 2010 version of Excel so it should be fine on all current flavours.

Enjoy!
